# MarseyCrossingBot

## How It Works

- Sometimes, a group of Marseys will have been spotted congregating in an accessible area.
- These "wild" Marseys are living a rough life in the wild.
- To convince them to join your village, you can give them a hug.
- Hugs are more likely to succeed if your village is larger.
- If your hug is successful, you will win the Marsey over.
- If you have a village, a new post will be made welcoming the Marsey (if this is your first Marsey, `/h/marseycrossing` will automatically make a new thread and then the welcoming post).
- If your hug fails, you will no longer be able to convince the Marsey to join you.
- In addition, there is a chance the Marsey will be "scared off," preventing anyone else from catching them in that particular thread.
- If the Marsey sticks around, future hugs have a higher chance of being successful.
- Occasionally, a single lost Marsey might wander up to (randomly reply to) a post. When this happens, the first user with a pre-existing village to reply `/claim` instantly wins over the Marsey.

## What's Next

This project is meant to be a first try at a hole-based/bot-based game for rDrama. If people are interested, it's easy to expand and add features.
